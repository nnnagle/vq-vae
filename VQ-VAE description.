I want you to create a VQ-VAE.
The unit of modeling is a 30x30m pixel
The inputs are
K1 Time series of categorical rasters for times 1..T with resolution 30x30
K2 Time series of integer valued rasters for times 1..T with resolution 30x30
A NAIP raster at only time T that has resolution 10x10 so there is a 3x3 patch for each raster input

Each of the categorical K1 should be modeled as a D dimensional embedding
Each of the integer K2 should be normalized 
The NAIP should be normalized.

The codebook should be a representation with 1) a times series for each K1, and each K2
and 2) a value of the mean NAIP.
